Scales and optimizes your images using the tiny.pictures image processing service in the cloud and delivers them through worldwide CDN nodes.

== Description ==

Delivering your image assets as fast as possible to users around the world is vital for your website's success. This plugin replaces Wordpress' default responsive image behavior with the tiny.pictures cloud-based image processing service for optimized file sizes and response times.

Your image assets are run through our image scaling and optimization algorithms automatically before being delivered by lightning-fast caching nodes around the world. There's no development necessary.

There's a [free plan](https://tiny.pictures/#register) with 2 GB of traffic per month which is sufficient for most hobby projects. tiny.pictures can scale with you and offers plans for [any amount of traffic](https://tiny.pictures/#pricing) as your website grows.
